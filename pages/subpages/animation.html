                <p>The physical exploration of the Moon 
                    began when Luna 2, a space probe launched
                     by the Soviet Union, made an impact on 
                     the surface of the Moon on September 14, 
                     1959. Six missions landed humans on the Moon, 
                    beginning with Apollo 11 in July 1969, 
                    during which Neil Armstrong became the 
                    first person to walk on the Moon.</p>

                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <p>Mariner 9 was launched successfully 
                    on May 30, 1971, and became the first 
                    artificial satellite of Mars when it 
                    arrived and went into orbit. Curiosity 
                    is a rover that was sent my NASA on November 26, 2011
                    that changed our knowledge on Mars. Mars 2020 is a Mars 
                    rover mission that includes the rover Perseverance and the 
                    small robotic, coaxial helicopter Ingenuity.</p>

                <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                <p>The exploration of Jupiter has been conducted 
                    via close observations by automated spacecraft. 
                    It began with the arrival of Pioneer 10 into 
                    the Jovian system in 1973, and, as of 2016, 
                    has continued with eight further spacecraft 
                    missions. As of now, NASAâ€™s Juno spacecraft, 
                    which arrived in the Jovian system in July 2016, 
                    is currently studying the giant planet from orbit.</p>
